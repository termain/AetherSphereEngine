#SkyBlazer

AetherSphereEngine project number 1. A six degree of freedom rocket simulation intended for trajectory optimization and Monte Carlo analysis with arbitrary precision support that can be run distributed across multiple systems.

#Components Needed

* Gravity model
* 6 degree of freedom, variable mass, rigid body dynamics simulation
* Atmosophere model
* Applied force models -- engines, aerodynamic, etc.
* Integrator/ODE solver
* Trajectory Model
* Optimizer
